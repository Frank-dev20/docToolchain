== Introduction and Goals

The tool _Structurizr_, created by Simon Brown, bringt the Diagrams-as-Code to the next level.
It reads a textual architecture model and generates diagrams in various formats for all views defined on this model.
In addition, it allows the user to manually layout the generated diagrams.

The goal is to create an integration of the structurizr approach for docToolchain.
